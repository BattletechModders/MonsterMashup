# MonsterMashup
This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) game 

## TODO
- Link init of units. Maybe use support unit construct to avoid init tracking?
- Should component death == dead turret? In case of location destruction, yes
- On parent death, kill turret
- Allow setting LoS on component
- How to allow mutable pilotDefs?
- Handle units that spawn during play (do we want to allow this)
